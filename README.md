## Quick overview

This repository hosts a **multi-agent CAMEL-AI workforce** that

1. collects a candidate‚Äôs preferences via a Human-in-the-Loop tool,
2. queries LinkUp for ranked Python-developer jobs,
3. gathers interview-prep resources from the open web,
4. produces a 14-day study plan in Markdown, and
5. spawns an *Embodied* agent that converts the Markdown to HTML and serves it at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

All agents run locally with one command (`poetry run app`) and rely only on OpenAI API keys, LinkUp API keys, and Brave API keys.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/jobsearch.git
cd jobsearch
poetry install
```

> **Key packages**
>
> * `camel-ai 0.2.59` ‚Äì multi-agent framework with EmbodiedAgent & Workforce ([docs.camel-ai.org][1])
> * `markdown 3.8` ‚Äì converts the coach‚Äôs Markdown (tables support) to HTML ([python-markdown.github.io][2])
> * `flask 3.1` ‚Äì lightweight server; runs happily in a background thread ([Stack Overflow][3])
> * `humanlayer 0.7.7` ‚Äì Human-as-tool bridge for preference capture ([humanlayer.dev][4])
> * `linkup-sdk 0.2.5` ‚Äì low-latency job-search API (`depth="standard"` is fastest) ([docs.linkup.so][5])

Note: This might take a while to install due to dependencies of CamelAI including such packages as `triton`.

## Environment

Create a `.env` in the project root:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # All keys are required, no fallback is provided
LINKUP_API_KEY=...
BRAVE_API_KEY=...
MODEL_PLATFORM=openai        # defaults shown here, you can skip those
MODEL_TYPE=gpt_4o_mini
```

The Pydantic settings loader auto-detects these variables at runtime.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the pipeline

```bash
poetry run app
```

* The **PreferenceAgent** asks six questions through HumanLayer; answer in the console.
* The **JobSearchAgent** calls LinkUp (`depth="standard"`, 12 s timeout) and returns 3-5 jobs ranked by salary DESC. ([docs.linkup.so][5])
* The **WebAgent** fetches top interview resources with a Brave search wrapper, via a Brave search tool from official CamelAI toolkit.
* The **PlannerAgent** plans the 14-day study schedule and creates a Markdown of the full workforce run.
* Finally, **WebPresenterAgent** writes `app.py` and boots Flask in a separate thread.
